# Röhrchen

Röhrchen [rˈøːɾçən] provides pipes which can transfer items in large
quantities from one place to another.

As of right now, it provides Glass Pipes.
These can only be placed in a clear way where always only one
input and one output are possible. Each input begins with a Pump,
which also determines the rate of the transferred items. The output of a pipe
can be either kept empty or directly lead into a container like a Chest or a Barrel.
